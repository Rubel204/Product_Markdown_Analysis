Product Markdown Analysis

## Summary
In this project, I conducted a comprehensive analysis of product sales performance before and after applying price markdowns. The primary goal was to assess the impact of discounted pricing on overall sales volume
and revenue. Additionally, I performed a category-wise comparison (Skincare, Bodycare, Makeup) of our product prices against key competitors to evaluate pricing competitiveness. Seasonal trends were also analyzed
to identify peak sales periods and understand how markdowns influence customer behavior across different times of the year. This analysis provided valuable insights into pricing strategy, customer preferences, and
market positioning.
